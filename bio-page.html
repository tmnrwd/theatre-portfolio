                <h3 class="d-flex justify-content-center">Bio</h3>
                Tim’s an emerging theatre-maker from Sheffield. He&#39;s queer, disabled, and happily mining them
                both
                for
                material.<br>
                He loves theatre, fantasy novels, and his favourite form of escapism, video games. He was raised
                Catholic so
                he&#39;s also got a weird obsession with religious iconography.<br>
                If pushed, Tim would describe himself as &quot;eloquent, charismatic, and extremely
                modest&quot;.<br>
                His qualifications include an unused Master&#39;s degree in Chemistry, technical certification, and
                training
                in
                dramatherapy-adjacent clowning.<br>
                He uses personal and confessional writing to make the skeleton of a show, and adds movement, music,
                comedy, and live art elements as the muscle, organs, and skin.<br>
                As a trauma survivor, Tim values making himself, his collaborators, and his audiences feel cared for
                and
                supported. This lets him face difficult topics whilst keeping everyone safe. He really loves
                vulnerability
                and
                intimacy in performance.<br>
                He shares untold and misunderstood stories with audiences to inspire compassion for people that
                society
                doesn&#39;t really GET, like living on Death Row, or with depression or PTSD.<br>

                He’s been supported and mentored by Theatre Delicatessen Sheffield, Third Angel, and Forced
                Entertainment.

                with a focus on programming emerging artists from the North.<br>

                <h3 class="d-flex justify-content-center">Forthcoming Work</h3>

                with the
                University of Sheffield's Festival of the Mind.
                He's also working on <i>What do you Wish you'd Learned at School?</i>, a show about how well
                education
                prepares
